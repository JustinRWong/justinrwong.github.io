#### Intro
I am a student at UC Berkeley, where I study Computer Science and pursue my passions in Energy and Resources and Entrepreneurship & Technology.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in climate change, energy and resources, social impact, education, and space. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in San Francisco and open to Zoom chats in our COVID era.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At Tesla, I have learned how to build and release software applications on the Digital Products Division, leverage kubernetes for orchestration, communicate effectively with technical individuals to increase productivity and unblock blockers, work in an Agile environment. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications.
